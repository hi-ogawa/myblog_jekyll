I've been using Javascript for a few months, but actually I haven't learn this language
systematically, which means I just put my codes all by intutition and learned what works by
try and error. That is not a productive work at all.

Recently, I started to learn some front-end javascript frameworks but those things seems
nothing but magic to me. Basically, I don't want to use too much magic feature,
so I feel I should start to look at source code but that's totally far from my knowledge
of javascript.

From these experience, I decided to look over [this tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) by w3cscool.

Here, I write some basics I didn't know or what's different from my guess about javascript.
